# [Hyperskill project] Minesweeper (Kotlin)
This project will teach you how to work with lists in Kotlin. You will be dealing with algorithms for generating the minefield and processing the player moves.

## About
They say a minesweeper makes only two mistakes in their life: the first is their choice of occupation, and the second one is fatal. In this project, you will create your own, safe "Minesweeper" – a game that will be a brain teaser for both you and your players.

## What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Here’s what awaits you:

# Stage 1/5 Lay the groundwork
Generate your first game field with mines!

# Stage 2/5 Flexible mines
Let the user enter the number of mines in the game field.

# Stage 3/5 Look around you
Check how many mines are around.

# Stage 4/5 Prepare for the battle
Implement the rules of the game.

# Stage 5/5 Battle
Be a real sapper. Find all the mines.
